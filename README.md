# Immigration-Game-APP
A React Native educational game exploring the obstacles, inequalities, and lived experiences of immigrants throughout U.S. history.
- Overview
The Immigration Challenge Game is an interactive mobile experience built with React Native and Expo. Players navigate three historically grounded time periods, making decisions that reveal the complexity of immigrating to the United States. Each scenario highlights real policy barriers, social inequality, and the uncertainty faced by immigrants seeking opportunity and citizenship.
Born from my research in an immigration history course and my interest in technology for social impact, this project combines storytelling, historical accuracy, and game design into an engaging educational tool.
